## Movement Tool

The movement tool (named **Trick Jumping Tool**) allows holders to perform several movement techniques:
* Roll (hold `shift`)
* Dive (`shift` midair)
* Crouch (hold `c`)
* Ground pound (`c` midair)
* Dive cancel & ground pound cancel (`space` midair)
* Jump (press `space`)
* Long jump (roll + jump / move & crouch + jump)
* Back flip (crouch + jump)
* Triple jump / consecutive jumps (hold jump)

Extra notes:
* Bonking & wall jumping isn't implemented.
* You have more time frame to jump after walking off a platform.

With its current configurations, one can perform (at extreme):
* 24 studs tall jump
* 35 studs gap jump


## Credits

The movements are inspired by that of Super Mario, Robot 64, and Stars Align.
